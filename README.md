# Example code for Getting on the Refactor Tractor talk

Slides are available at [https://refactor-tractor.ez.codes]

`dateFormat` and `UserInfo` examples can be found in

- `src/__tests__exampleTests.test.jsx`: the starter code
- `completed_examples/exampleTests_with_tests.test.jsx`: with the tests
- `completed_examples/exampleTests_done.test.jsx`: with the refactor of formatDate

And there's a version of Ye Olde Farme Shoppe with the new requirements on the branch `complete`
It's worth noting, that for each change we needed to make, refactoring code made the actual change required trivial. They became config changes rather than real code changes.
